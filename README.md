# DA-Case-Studies
This is a case study project on an imaginary company named Cyclistic. The goal of this analysis is the following:
* Identify trends in how casual riders and member riders use bike differently.
* Distinguish the differences and use the story shown by the data to create solutions to convert casual bikers to member bikers.

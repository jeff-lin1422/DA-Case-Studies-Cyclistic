# DA-Case-Studies
This is a case study where I work as an junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at a imaginary company called Cyclistic. I was assigned the problem of how annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently to casual bikers. To clarify, a casual bikers are someone who purchase single-ride or full-day pass whereas annual members purchased a subscription for a year. Through these insights, I can make recommendations to the executive team regarding how to convert casual riders to annual riders for maximum profit. Because this is an imaginary company, the data set I will be using is a public data set that explores how different customers uses bikes. This data set is made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

The goal of this analysis is the following:
* Identify trends in how casual riders and member riders use bike differently.
* Distinguish the differences and use the story shown by the data to create solutions to generate the maximum profit.

Method for organizing the data:
* Identified days of week each bike was used.
* Removed all trips that are under 60 seconds.
